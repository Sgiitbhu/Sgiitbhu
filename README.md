## ⚡ About Me

I’m a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at IIT (BHU), with a Minor in Applied Mathematics. I am passionate about core domains like power electronics, motor drives, embedded systems, and control systems, and actively seek opportunities to apply these in real-world engineering challenges.

Alongside my academic and technical interests, I’ve taken up leadership roles across campus — from directing IITBHU MUN to co-heading the Wellness Council — experiences that have sharpened my public speaking, teamwork, and strategic planning skills.

I believe in combining strong theoretical fundamentals with practical application, and I’m constantly learning through projects, online certifications, and hands-on experimentation with electronics.
